# cshannon

Compression and Decompression a la Shannon's algorithm.

This is a pet project. All plans are funny money, code quality is (hopefully)
reasonable, and readability is prioritized over efficiency.

## TODO

### Learn

* Profile and compare various implementations.

### Blog

* Write Blog post about use of private tests for encapsulated packages
* Concretize ideas for data viz blog post comparing Fano, Shannon and Huffman
  encodings
  * [extra credit] WASM compilation of cshannon to allow users to input text.
