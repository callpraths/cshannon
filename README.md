# cshannon

Compression and Decompression a la Shannon's algorithm.

This is a pet project. All plans are funny money, code quality is (hopefully)
reasonable, and readability is prioritized over efficiency.

## TODO

### Implemenation

* Implement Shannon encoding scheme
* Implement Fano encoding scheme
* Implement Huffman encoding scheme

### Hygiene

* Github CI setup
* Github badge setup
* Create crate and releases.

### Learn

* Get help from rust-users etc to make the `Tokens` trait cleaner.
* micro-benchmarks: Write some, make it faster!
* fuzz testing: Write some, find bugs!

### Blog

* Write Blog post about use of private tests for encapsulated packages
* Concretize ideas for data viz blog post comparing Fano, Shannon and Huffman
  encodings
  * [extra credit] WASM compilation of cshannon to allow users to input text.
